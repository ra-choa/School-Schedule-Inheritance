# school_schedule

<!-- We would like to derive a MiddleSchoolStudent child class. MiddleSchoolStudent will have all the attributes and behaviors of Student, but it will also:

Track whether the student receives school transportation using the boolean attribute gets_transportation (can be set in the constructor, defaults to False)
Update the summary method to include information about the student's transportation status
Include tests for the additional functionality
There is one test provided (currently commented out)
Uncomment the test and implement the MiddleSchoolStudent class so that it passes
If there is time, implement additional tests for the MiddleSchoolStudent class (review the HighSchoolStudent class for ideas) -->

<!-- Points to keep in mind:
Inheriting from Student
Default parameters
Use super() when writing:
constructor
summary()
Helper methods
Testing approach -->
